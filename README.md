## Design

### Colour Scheme
<img src="assets/docs/readme_screenshots/colormap.png">
The colour palette was generated by <a href="http://colormind.io/image/">Colormind</a> when submitted a world map found on a google search. 

### Fonts
Itim from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Itim?preview.text=Geography&preview.text_type=custom) was chosen as the font as it was clear, playful and had a hand-written feel which I felt suited the theme of the game. 

### Structure

The structure of the website was designed to be easy to navigate. 

The game consist of the following screens:

- A home page / start screen with game title, instructions how to play game and user login
- Choose game difficulty level screen with name displayed in top corner of screen
- Main game screen - it contains interactive map to click, questions clearly displayed, number of questions remaining in the round and current score which dynamically updates
- End page with most recent score from local storage
- The contact page modal with contact form which allows users to send an email to the developer and provide their feedback
- A separate 404 error page

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Frameworks, Libraries & Tools

- Favicon.cc for getting the site favicon
- Font Awesome for main title of game
- Git was used for version control to push the code to GitHub
- GitHub was used as a remote repository to store project code
- Google Fonts
- Chrome dev tools were used for debugging of the code and check site for responsiveness
- WC3 Validator, Jigsaw W3 Validator, JShint, Wave Validator and Lighthouse were all used to validate the website

## Features

The website has 4 webpages consisting of a number of particular features

### Home page
The home page contains:
- The title of the game with spinning world icon (user-stories: 1)
- A short explanation of how to play (user-stories: 1)
- An input form for the user to enter their name (user-stories: 2)
- A start game button

### Standout feature: 

#### Username input
- For start game button to bring user to next page, the user needs to enter a username of at least 4 characters long into the input field. If the input field is left blank and user clicks out of field, the background of the input field changes to red and the placeholder text changes to remind the user to complete the field. Furthermore, if only 3 letters are entered for example, then a alert message is displayed with message that at least 4 characters long username needs to be chosen. Once a valid username has been provided, the username is displayed next to the user icon on the next screen and user is able to select the difficulty level of the game.
- Username remains displayed on all game screens
- (user-stories: 2)

### Level page 
- Username displayed at top of page (user-stories: 2)
- buttons to choose difficulty level of game by fetching different json files that contain increasingly difficult questions (user-stories: 3, 14)

### Game page
- Interactive world map (svg) where the countries are individually defined into paths
- Heads up display that contains the username as input by user on home page (user-stories: 2), dynamic questions and score counter (user-stories: 6, 8)
- Question display that updates country every new question to a max of 10. The countries do not repeat. 

### Standout feature: 

###  Interactive world map
- When question is asked map can be clicked to try and answer the question. If correct answer is picked, the country lights ip green and if the incorrect country is picked the country lights up red (user-stories: 4). A new question appears either if correct country is chosen or user has reached max guesses(3) (user-stories: 5). Scores updates depending on how many guesses it took the user to get the right country (1st attempt = 3 points, 2 attempt = 2 points, 3rd attempt = 1 point) (user-stories: 6)

### End page 
- Dislays most recent score along with username (user-stories: 2)
- Play again button that allow user to restart the game by bringing back to select difficulty screen (user-stories: 10)
- Wanted to include code for a modal pop up feedback form that was hidden until feedback button was clicked and high scores table which i wpuld have gotten from local storage but i ran out of time. This will be future features of the website however.
