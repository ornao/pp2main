## Design

### Colour Scheme
<img src="assets/docs/readme_screenshots/colormap.png">
The colour palette was generated by <a href="http://colormind.io/image/">Colormind</a> when submitted a world map found on a google search. 

### Fonts
Itim from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Itim?preview.text=Geography&preview.text_type=custom) was chosen as the font as it was clear, playful and had a hand-written feel which I felt suited the theme of the game. 

### Structure

The structure of the website was designed to be easy to navigate. 

The game consist of the following screens:

- A home page / start screen with game title, instructions how to play game and user login
- Choose game difficulty level screen with name displayed in top corner of screen
- Main game screen - it contains interactive map to click, questions clearly displayed, number of questions remaining in the round and current score which dynamically updates
- End page with most recent score from local storage
- The contact page modal with contact form which allows users to send an email to the developer and provide their feedback
- A separate 404 error page

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- CSS
- JavaScript

### Frameworks, Libraries & Tools

- Favicon.io for making the site favicon
- Font Awesome for main title of game
- Git was used for version control to push the code to GitHub
- GitHub was used as a remote repository to store project code
- Google Fonts
- Chrome dev tools were used for debugging of the code and check site for responsiveness
- WC3 Validator, Jigsaw W3 Validator, JShint, Wave Validator and Lighthouse were all used to validate the website

## Features

The website has 4 webpages consisting of a number of particular features

### Home page
The home page contains:
- The title of the game with spinning world icon (user-stories: 1)
- A short explanation of how to play (user-stories: 1)
- An input form for the user to enter their name (user-stories: 2)
- A start game button

### Standout feature: 

#### Username input
- For start game button to bring user to next page, the user needs to enter a username of at least 4 characters long into the input field. If the input field is left blank and user clicks out of field, the background of the input field changes to red and the placeholder text changes to remind the user to complete the field. Furthermore, if only 3 letters are entered for example, then a alert message is displayed with message that at least 4 characters long username needs to be chosen. Once a valid username has been provided, the username is displayed next to the user icon on the next screen and user is able to select the difficulty level of the game.
- Username remains displayed on all game screens
- (user-stories: 2)
